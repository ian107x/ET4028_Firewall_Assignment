(1250)Evaluation Question
(1260)1. The packet from 166.60.6.6 is denied entry into the network due to rule [190], which denies entry from the evilgroup ip address range into the network
(1270)2. This request will be denied as rule[200] on the internet facing interface denies traffic entering from outside the corporate network that has an ip address matching the range of the corporate network - such packets are suspicious by nature and likely always spoofed.
(1280)3. This will be permitted as per rule [240] which permits any address to contact the dns server. Rule [360] and [460](rule repeated on an inbound and outbound rule to ensure valid packets are not dropped) allows dns server to communicate with any other machine on port 53, which may also offer the potential for return traffic between the two machines.
(1290)4. No, this packet should not be permitted, as the web server is on port 443, not port 80, as seen by rule[260]. As the packet should not meet the permit rquirements of any rule, it would be denied by [290] which serves as an explicit version of the implcit deny principle, denying packets that are not explicitly permitted.
(1300)5. Yes, this should be allowed as per rule[260], as the port number is suitable(>1023) and is accessing the correct port on the web server at 443. Return traffic should be allowed at [340] and [450] evaluate rule, as rule[260] is a reflexive rule.
(1310)6. 136.201,22,1 is part of the partner etwork ,which can ssh the syslog server and send logs to it, as per rules [220] and [230]. [230] is a tcp connection on port 514 to allow logs to be sent, and is repeated on [890]. A such, this connection should be allowed, but syslog server will not start any communications with devices outside of admin network, as per rule[1140], so there should not be return traffic.
(1320)7. This will not be allowed, as rule[230] states that the port for the 136.201.200.1 must be GREATER than 1023, because it will not be allowed due to this, the packet would be dropped by an implicit deny(or deny rule [290] which serves essentially the same purpose)
(1330)8. Border router rip configuration starting at line [40] to [105] does not include any allowance for router 4.4.4.4, so it should not be allowed.
(1340)9. This should not be allowed under normal circumstances, as the web server can only establish traffic to mysql, ntp and syslog servers. If the established traffic is not return traffic for rule[450], then it will be dropped due to not being explicitly allowed(rule [560]).
(1350)10. rule[530] allows web server 147.17.1.70 to establish tcp connection with mysql database server and creates a reflect for "webtosql". Web server of address 147.17.1.20 is not explicitly permitted, as only 147.17.1.70 and workstations can access mysql database, so this will not be allowed.(should be denied by [560])
(1360)11. rule [480], and [900] which allows internal machines to send logs to syslog on port 514, allows web server to establish tcp session with syslog server(again the sending of logs is allowed by this tcp session), so yes, this should be allowed.
(1370)12. Any inside or outside machine can access the dns server, for outside machiens it is rule[240] that allows this, and return traffic may be allowed by rule [460] and [360], which allows the dns server to access any other machine.
(1380)13. Mysql server can be access by the web server, but can only react to requests itself, such as at rule[1020], which evaluates return traffic to the web server. As a connection started by mysql database should not be allowed except for syslog logs, this connection should be dropped on implicit deny, or explicit deny any rule[1070].
(1390)14. Rule [1040] allows mysql server(an dinternal machines) to send logs to the syslog server. This rule is a tcp request that allowss machines to contact port 514 of the syslog server, and as such, should be allowed, as it is the rule that allows logs ot be sent. 
(1400)15. PC 147.17.2.67:T1234 appears to be a workstation pc, based on its address. This pc can access any web server on port 443 from a port greater than 1023, as per rule[620] and [380], which is a reflect rule, so return traffic should be handled by evaluate rule [270].
(1410)16. Yes, as this is a workstation pc, traffic from it to mysql is permitted by rule [920], which is a reflect rule, so return traffic is handled by the evaluate rule [1010]
(1420)17.This would not be allowed as rule[380] and [620] only allows the work stations to contact external web servers on port 443, there is no explicit perit for them to access external devices on port 25, so it would be denied.
(1430)18.No, it should not be allowed without a previous request. Rule[270] and [490]evaluates webservertaffic, which would be a "temporary rule" of sorts defined by rule[620]and[380], so the response traffic requires this temporary rule to exist in order to be allowed.
(1440)19. No, as rule at [680] permits access from admin pc to dns in particular on port 53, not 22, so as the communication in question would not be explicitly allowed, it would be denied.
(1450)20. No, only pc's of range 147.17.4.1-127 are permitted to access via anydesk, as per rule[1130]. The pc in this question falls outside of that range, so the traffic would be denied due to not being explicitly allowed.
